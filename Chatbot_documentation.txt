# Financial Chatbot Prototype

## Description
This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It simulates an AI assistant that responds to basic financial queries using predefined answers based on Microsoft's FY2024 10-K report.

## Supported Questions
- What is the total revenue?
- How has net income changed over the last year?
- What is the cash flow from operating activities?
- What are the total liabilities?

## How It Works
- The chatbot runs in your terminal.
- It uses `if-else` logic to return answers based on predefined financial data.
- Run the script and interact with the chatbot through the command line.

## Limitations
- Only supports exact, predefined questions.
- Does not interpret variations in phrasing.
- Does not connect to live financial data or APIs.
